#Command Line Tools
Elastic responds over an HTTP interface and as such you can do a quick check of whether or not your SilverStripe data has been saved using this approach.

##Using Curl to Check Indexed Data
The following is for UNIX based systems.

###Checking Cluster Health
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty'
```
###Show Indexes
```bash
curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
```

Example output, showing three indexes, one each for English, German and Thai
```
health status index            pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
yellow open   searchtest_en_us   5   1        731            0      6.3mb          6.3mb
yellow open   searchtest_th_th   5   1          1            0     16.5kb         16.5kb
yellow open   searchtest_de_de   5   1        342            0      3.5mb          3.5mb
```

###Server Status
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9200/?pretty'
```
Example ouput in JSON format:
```json
{
  "status" : 200,
  "name" : "Aralune",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "1.7.0",
    "build_hash" : "929b9739cae115e73c346cb5f9a6f24ba735a743",
    "build_timestamp" : "2015-07-16T14:31:07Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "4.10.4"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

###Show Document Mapping
The following command shows, in JSON format, the format of a SilverStripe content type from
an elastic search perspective.
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_mapping?pretty'
```
The output is verbose, this is a sample showing the mapping for a BlogEntry.

```json
"BlogEntry" : {
        "properties" : {
          "BlogCategory" : {
            "properties" : {
              "ID" : {
                "type" : "integer"
              },
              "Title" : {
                "type" : "string",
                "analyzer" : "stemmed",
                "fields" : {
                  "standard" : {
                    "type" : "string",
                    "analyzer" : "standard"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          },
          "Content" : {
            "type" : "string",
            "analyzer" : "stemmed",
            "fields" : {
              "standard" : {
                "type" : "string",
                "analyzer" : "standard"
              }
            }
          },
          "IsInSiteTree" : {
            "type" : "boolean"
          },
          "Link" : {
            "type" : "string"
          },
          "Locale" : {
            "type" : "string",
            "index" : "not_analyzed"
          },
          "Tags" : {
            "type" : "string",
            "analyzer" : "stemmed",
            "fields" : {
              "standard" : {
                "type" : "string",
                "analyzer" : "standard"
              }
            }
          },
          "Title" : {
            "type" : "string",
            "analyzer" : "stemmed",
            "fields" : {
              "standard" : {
                "type" : "string",
                "analyzer" : "standard"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
```

###Show Some Documents Indexed
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_search?pretty'
```
You can vary the number by adding a size parameter, which is the number of results returned.

###Show Some Documents Indexed Against a Particular Index
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/YOUR_INDEX_NAME/_search?pretty'
```
You can vary the number by adding a size parameter, which is the number of results returned.

###Search an Index for a Term
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/YOUR_INDEX_NAME/_search?q=YOUR_SEARCH_TERM&pretty'
```
You can see the same search with highlighted results like this:
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/YOUR_INDEX_NAME/_search?q=YOUR_SEARCH_TERM&highlighter=true&pretty'
```

##Aliases
An easier way on UNIX to use these commands is aliasing.

Add the following to the file ~/.bash_alias on the account you are developing with.

```bash
alias elasticstatus="curl 'http://localhost:9200/?pretty'"
alias elasticclusterhealth="curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty'"
alias elasticindexes="curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'"
alias elasticmappings="curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_mapping?pretty'"
alias elasticmanydocs="curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_search?size=1000&pretty'"
searchelastica() { curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/$1/_search?q=$2&pretty" ;}
```
A suitable workflow for checking if you SilverStripe data has been indexed as expected
is this:

```bash

>$ elasticindexes
health status index            pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
yellow open   searchtest_en_us   5   1        731            0      6.3mb          6.3mb
yellow open   searchtest_th_th   5   1          1            0     16.5kb         16.5kb
yellow open   searchtest_de_de   5   1        342            0      3.5mb          3.5mb
