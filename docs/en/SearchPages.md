#Search Pages
##Introduction
It is now possible to have multiple search pages in a site, each with it's own
separate restrictions as to which class or classes are searchable.  Asides from
the traditional 'search all of the SiteTree' this module provides more
flexibility.  An administrator can do the following:

* Create a search page that searches just blog posts
* Create a search page that searches just Flickr photos, represented as
DataObjects
* Fields within the search can be weighted, e.g. make the Title twice as
important as the Content
* Vary the number of search results from the default of 10
* Add classes to manipulate the search and the results, allowing for aggregated
searches

Note that the above changes are instant, there is no need to reindex the data,
it is the query that is altered.  The content administrator can make these
changes within the CMS.

* Override the template of search results, necessary when dealing with results
not having a Title or Link.

##Adding a Search Page to a Site
Using the standard mechanism for adding a page in the CMS, add a page of type
`ElasticSearchPage` at an appropriate location for the search intended, e.g.
`/search`, `/blog/search`, or `/photos/search`.

##Configuring a Search Page
###Search Site Tree Only
Select the 'Site Tree Only' checkbox, and then save the page.  This will
simulate the standard SilverStripe search, namely all pages in the SiteTree,
but using Elasticsearch for the free text searching.

###Selected List of ClassNames
It is possible to restrict the classes that are searched, useful for example if
searching a particular subsection of a site likes of a blog.  In the example
below only pages of type Blog or BlogPost are returned from the search.

Note that a list of the available classes is shown just below for reference.
This can be copied and pasted into the TagField of available classes.

"List of Available Classes")

###Number of Results
The default number of results is 10, this can be changed to any number as
required.  In the screenshot below, the number of results has been changed to 20

###Field Editing
After saving an Elastic Search Page, the fields available will be shown in the
Search/Fields tab.  The fields available from the list of selected classes will
be shown and are editable.  Note that a field weight <= 0 is invalid and the
page cannot be saved.

![List of Searchable Fields]

"List of Searchable Fields")
* Weighting - adjust the weight of that field, making it more or less important
* Use for Search? - true to use the field in the search, false not to
* Use for Similar Search? - true to use the field when doing a simiilarity
search, false not to
* Show Search Highlights - show query terms highlight in the search results for
the field in question

"Editing Weighting")

If a field searched for is not present in all the objects being searched, the
search does not fail.  An example of this would be a BlogPost having BlogTags
associated with it, whereas of course a standard Page does not have this field.
Page and BlogPost however have Title and Content fields in common.

##Autocompletion
Autocompletion should only be indexed for relatively short fields as it is
extremely verbose in the number of terms indexed.  Good examples of suitable
fields are the title of a page or the full name of a Member.

![Autocomplete]

"Editing Autocompletion")

To enable autocomplete click on the Search/AutoComplete tab.  A drop down list
of autocompleteable fields is shown, of which only one can be selected.  There
are 3 options for what can happen when autocompleted text is selected.

* GoToRecord - go directly to a page showing the record whose field was
autocompleted
* Similar - find objects similar to that represented by the selected
autocomplete text
* Search - search using the terms of the title of the selected autocomplete text

##Aggregations
Aggregations are sufficiently complex they are on a
[separate page](./Aggregation.md).

##Similarity Searching
A similarity search, or in Elasticsearch parlance a 'more like this' query finds
documents similar o the one used as the basis for the search.  It has several
configurable parameters and some experimentation may be required depending on
site content.

* Stop Words - terms to ignore when querying
* Minimum term frequency - minimum number of times a term can appear in a field
to be used
* Maximum terms selected - the maximum number of terms selected to be used for
similarity search
* Minimum document frequency - the minimum number of documents a term appears in
* Maximum document frequency - the maximum number of documents a term appears
in.  Can be used to filter stop words
* Minimum word length - the minimum length of a term for it to be considered
* Maximum word length - the maximum length of a term for it to be considered
* Number of %age of matching terms - see
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-minimum-should-match.html
for a detailed explanation.

Note that the default values are as per the Elasticsearch documentation.
Clicking on the button 'Restore Defaults' restores these values (after a Save).

##Overriding the SearchPage Template
It is most likely necessary to override the default template when rendering
search results for DataObjects, as they may not have the methods _Title_ and
_AbsoluteLink_ necessary to render them.

This requires another module that can alter the template for a given page.

###Installation of Template Override Module
####Composer
```bash
composer require weboftalent/template-override 3.1.x-dev
```
####Git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gordonbanderson/template-override.git
cd template-override
git checkout 3.1
```
###Using Template Override
Simple navigate to the tab 'Template', or i18n equivalent, and enter the name of
the template in the text field provided.  If the value is left empty, the normal
template will be used.
